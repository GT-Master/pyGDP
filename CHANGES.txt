Changes
=======

1.2.0 (2013-04-23)
---------------

- Several improvements to install/setup details.
- CSW search implemented for getDatasetURIs. 'title, abstract, [uri1, uri2, ...]' is response format.
- urls returned from CSW search that contain dodsC have http replaced with dods.
- Examples and tests expanded and fixed up substantially.
- Network and other errors while checking process status are excepted up to ten times before failure.
- Improvement to FeatureWeightedGridStatistics algorithm, now implements correct multiplicity for all inputs.
- Fixed up _getFeatureCollectionGeoType to work more predictably and protect from naive requests.
- In all algorithms, value='all_values' now returns a feature collection that returns all values, 
  otherwise explicit gmlIDs or values are required.
- Now catching invalid shapefile attribute values and raising an exception when they are not found.

1.1.1 (2013-01-10)
---------------

- Versioning applied at 1.1.1, project well underway, still a work in progress.
- Basic functionality in place to get input parameters and execute all GDP algorithms.
